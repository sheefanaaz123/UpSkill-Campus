##**Objective:**
The goal of this project was to forecast crop yields in India using machine learning regression models. The models were evaluated based on historical crop production, weather, and soil data.

##**Regression Models:**
- Decision Tree
- Linear Regression
- XGBoost
- Random Forest

##**Performance Metrics:**
Models were assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

##**Best Performing Model:**
The XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance with an MSE of 113.12 and an MAE of 6.52, highlighting its accuracy in crop yield prediction.

##**Significance:**
The XGBoost model's accuracy provides valuable insights for stakeholders, aiding in optimal resource allocation and fostering sustainable agricultural practices.

##**Impact on Agriculture:**
The project's findings have substantial potential for India's agricultural sector, offering data-driven guidance for farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders. This information can enhance productivity and decision-making processes.

##**Internship Experience:**
This internship provided a unique opportunity to address real-world industrial problems and implement solutions. It was a comprehensive and enriching experience, offering exposure to diverse challenges and allowing for the practical application of machine learning techniques.

##**Conclusion:**
In summary, this internship has been a valuable experience, contributing not only to my professional growth but also offering practical insights and solutions for enhancing the efficiency of crop yield forecasting in the agricultural sector.
